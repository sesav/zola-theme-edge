Here's my first ever demo — made after learning Ableton Live 12 and subscribing to Splice!

This post demonstrates the YouTube shortcode functionality in the Zola theme. The shortcode allows embedding YouTube videos directly in blog posts using a simple syntax.

Code example:
```
\{{ youtube(id="dc2_LHrQFCg") \}}
```

Just remove backslash – `\` and youtube shortcode render video like this:

{{ youtube(id="dc2_LHrQFCg") }}

P.S.

On the cover photo is my X1 Carbon, which I used to make this demo, along with one of my headphones Bose QC45.
