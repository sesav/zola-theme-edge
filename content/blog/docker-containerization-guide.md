Docker has revolutionized how we package and deploy applications. Learn the fundamentals of containerization.

## Why Docker?

Docker solves the "it works on my machine" problem by packaging applications with all their dependencies into portable containers.

## Core Concepts

### Images vs Containers
- **Image**: Read-only template used to create containers
- **Container**: Running instance of an image

### Dockerfile Basics

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Build an image
docker build -t myapp .

# Run a container
docker run -p 3000:3000 myapp

# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop a container
docker stop container_id
```

## Docker Compose

For multi-container applications:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
```

## Best Practices

1. Use official base images
2. Minimize image layers
3. Don't run as root
4. Use .dockerignore files
5. Keep containers stateless

Docker simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across different environments.
