Rust combines the performance of C++ with the safety of high-level languages. Here's why it's gaining popularity.

## What Makes Rust Special?

Rust prevents common programming errors like null pointer dereferences and buffer overflows at compile time.

## Key Features

### Memory Safety
```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1; // s1 is moved, can't be used anymore
    
    // This would cause a compile error:
    // println!("{}", s1);
    
    println!("{}", s2); // This works
}
```

### Ownership System
- Each value has a single owner
- When owner goes out of scope, value is dropped
- No garbage collector needed

### Pattern Matching
```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}

match some_result {
    Ok(value) => println!("Success: {}", value),
    Err(error) => println!("Error: {}", error),
}
```

## Use Cases

1. **System Programming**: Operating systems, drivers
2. **Web Backends**: Fast, concurrent servers
3. **CLI Tools**: Reliable command-line applications
4. **WebAssembly**: High-performance web applications

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Create new project
cargo new my_project
cd my_project

# Build and run
cargo run
```

## Simple Example

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");
    
    let mut guess = String::new();
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");
        
    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
}
```

Rust's learning curve is steep, but the benefits in safety and performance make it worthwhile for systems programming.
