## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

## Key Concepts

### Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Examples: classification, regression
- Common algorithms: linear regression, decision trees

### Unsupervised Learning
- Works with unlabeled data
- Examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction
- Common algorithms: k-means, PCA

### Popular Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Simple example
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Getting Started

1. Learn Python fundamentals
2. Understand statistics basics
3. Practice with real datasets
4. Start with simple projects

Machine learning is a powerful tool that's becoming increasingly accessible to developers across all domains.
