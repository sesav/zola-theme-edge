## Popular Git Workflows

### Feature Branch Workflow
- Create branches for each feature
- Merge back to main when complete
- Keeps main branch stable

### Git Flow
- Main branches: main, develop
- Supporting branches: feature, release, hotfix
- More complex but structured

## Branch Naming Conventions

```bash
# Feature branches
feature/user-authentication
feature/payment-integration

# Bug fixes  
fix/header-alignment
bugfix/memory-leak

# Releases
release/v1.2.0
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

### Good Commit Messages
```bash
git commit -m "Add user authentication middleware

- Implement JWT token validation
- Add role-based access control
- Update API documentation"
```

### Atomic Commits
- One logical change per commit
- Makes reviews easier
- Simplifies rollbacks

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Interactive rebase to clean up commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Stash changes temporarily
git stash
git stash pop

# View commit history
git log --oneline --graph
```

## Merge vs Rebase

### When to Merge
- Preserves commit history
- Good for feature branches
- Creates merge commits

### When to Rebase
- Cleaner linear history
- Before merging to main
- Interactive rebase for cleanup

```bash
# Rebase feature branch onto main
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```

## Protecting Main Branch

### Branch Protection Rules
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks
- Restrict force pushes
- Require branches to be up to date

## Best Practices

1. **Small, Frequent Commits**: Easier to review and rollback
2. **Descriptive Messages**: Future you will thank present you
3. **Test Before Pushing**: Broken code slows everyone down
4. **Review Your Changes**: Use `git diff` before committing
5. **Keep Branches Updated**: Regular rebasing prevents conflicts

## Handling Conflicts

```bash
# When conflicts occur during merge
git status  # See conflicted files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add resolved-file.js
git commit
```

Good Git practices become second nature with consistent application across your team.
