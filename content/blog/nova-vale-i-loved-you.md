From time to time, I experiment with making music, learning different professional software, and of course studying music theory, and I also explore music AI tools ü§ì.

Recently, I watched a CBS segment where Dave Malkoff invited Rick Beato to demonstrate [how easy it is today to create music of very decent quality](https://youtu.be/8uf8CCTItVo?si=3iDHxgBC08vtobKZ&t=128), and to explain what needs to be done to protect real human artists as AI shakes up the music industry. Protecting copyright holders is a very important and serious topic, but that's not what this discussion is about right now.

In short, I became very interested in the story of Sadie Winters, created by Rick, and decided to see what I could come up with myself if I devoted a bit more time to making a track.

I created a virtual singer with a voice that truly matched my vision. I named her Nova Vale, and then I adapted one of my favorite poems by **Alexander Pushkin ‚Äî I Loved You (1829)** into an atmospheric rock ballad. After generating about 25‚Äì30 versions, I finally found the one that felt right. Just listen to what came out in the end it's incredible!
